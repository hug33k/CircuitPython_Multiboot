# Multiboot for NeoTrellis M4 (CircuitPython)

This tool will let you store multiple programs on your NeoTrellis M4 (using CircuitPython).

## Setup

1. Download this repository
2. Copy `code.py` and `multiboot.py` on your board
3. Create a folder named `programs`
4. Create a subfolder inside `programs` for each program that you want to store

## Usage

##Â My setup

NeoTrellis M4
- CircuitPython 6.0.0-beta.2
- Screen soldered on JST port (SSD1306 128x32px)
- Mostly in portrait mode (USB on left, rotation at 270).

I don't have any other CircuitPython-compatible board so I won't be able to test properly support for another device.
